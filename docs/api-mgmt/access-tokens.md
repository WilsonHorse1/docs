# Access Token

Access tokens are strings that identify the client of a Callable Recipe. The token value is a secret that is shared between a client and the Workato server. A token is passed to the API in an authorization header. The header must have a valid value for the call to succeed.

Workato supports two token formats: [Auth Token](/api-mgmt/auth-token.md) and [JSON Web Token (JWT)](/api-mgmt/jwt-token.md).

## Difference between Auth Token and JSON Web Token

| | Auth Token | JSON Web Token (JWT) |
| --------------------------------------------------- | --- | --- |
| Simple to setup and configure into the API request. | Yes | Yes |
| Represents a Workato Access Profile.                | Yes | Yes |
| Can be reused for multiple web applications.        | No  | Yes |
| Can be configured with token expiry.                | No  | No  |
