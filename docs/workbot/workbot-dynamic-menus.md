# Dynamic menus
![How dynamic menus work](~@img/workbot/workbot/how-dynamic-menus-work.png)
*Overview*

In Workbot command recipes that invoke modals or dialogs, a `select` field can be defined with dynamic menu options that become available at runtime.

*Menu options generated at runtime*

The dynamic menu options are generated by a secondary 'Dynamic menu recipe'. As its name suggests, this recipe handles 3 important things:

1. Monitors for dynamic menu events from dynamic menus in modals or dialogs,
2. Generates menu options, and
3. Returns the menu options to the primary command recipe.

## Configuring a Workbot parameter with dynamic menu options
In a Workbot command recipe,

1. Create a parameter
2. Under **Dialog control type**, choose **Select**.
3. Under **Menu options**, choose **Dynamic**.
4. Under dynamic menu recipe, enter the recipe ID of the dynamic menu recipe responsible for generating the menu options. At this point, you must have already created a dynamic menu recipe. To learn more about dynamic menu recipes, jump to [Dynamic menu recipes](#dynamic-menu-recipes).
5. (Optional) If you want to send more context to the dynamic menu recipe, you can pass parameters to it using the **Dynamic menu recipe params** field. Learn more in the [New dynamic menu event trigger](/workbot/workbot-triggers.md#command-input-fields) documentation.

When a user types in a dynamic menu field in a dialog, an event is sent to the dynamic menu recipe.

## Configuring a Workbot parameter with dynamic menu options in a Post dialog action
You can also configure a dynamic menu field in a **Post dialog** action. Under **Dialog form fields**, configure your JSON like the following:

```
[
  {
    "type": "select",
    "name": "your_parameter",
    "label": "Your parameter",
    "optional": false,
    "data_source": "external",
    "dynamic_menu_recipe":  "28748",
    "dynamic_menu_recipe_params": "stagename: Closed Won",
    "min_query_length": 3
  }
]
```

## Dynamic menu recipes
Dynamic menu recipes handle 3 important things:

1. **Monitor** for dynamic menu events from dynamic menus in modals or dialogs,
2. **Generates** menu options, and
3. **Returns** the menu options to the primary command recipe.

A typical dynamic menu recipes consist:

1. [New dynamic menu event](/workbot/workbot-triggers.md#new-dynamic-menu-event) trigger
2. An action that searches and retrieves records from an app (e.g. Salesforce). The search query is typically refined by using the 'typeahead' `Value` datapill from the **New dynamic menu event** trigger output.
Since a dynamic menu event occurs when a user types 3 characters into a dynamic menu field, the 'typeahead' `Value` datapill contains the 3 (or more) characters typed by the user.

3. [Return menu options](/workbot/workbot-actions.md#return-menu-options) action

## Setting up dynamic menu capabilities in custom Workbots
If you are using a custom bot, you will need to configure the **Options Load URL** of your bot in Slack first. This is the URL where Workato receives dynamic menu events for Workbot.

In your Slack app configuration page, go to:
> **Features > Interactive Components > Message Menus**

In the **Options Load URL**, key in a URL in this format:

> https://www.workato.com/slack_webhooks/data_source?coak_id=1234

where '1234' is your bot's custom OAuth ID. This ID can be found in the URL of your bot's custom OAuth profile.
