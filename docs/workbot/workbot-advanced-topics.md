# Advanced Workbot topics
Workbot for Slack supports a wide variety of Slack's interactive components (e.g. buttons, menus) as well as advanced Workbot features (e.g. updating messages, posting dialogs, slash command triggers). These components combined with advanced Workbot features, collectively allow you full control over the design of your bot's conversational interface.
