## How do you list your connector?
Listing your connector couldn't be easier. All users have the ability to list connectors directly from the share tab in your connector SDK console. Find out more about listing your connector [here](/developing-connectors/sdk/quick-Start.md#sharing-your-connector).

## Best practices - Listing a community connector
1. Scrubbing out any sensitive information from your connector code
When building your connector, you may have hardcoded sensitive information such as OAuth client IDs and secrets or API keys. Remember to scrub these values out before listing your connector on the community. These values would be compromised if others install your connector. Instead of hardcoding sensitive data, sensitive data should be collected as input fields from users.

2. Removing any code that may compromise data
Safety is a key priority in the Workato community. We conduct checks on connectors published to ensure that data sent to the connector is being handled in a safe and responsible manner. In cases where you may have sent payloads or responses from the API to a requestb.in for checking, make sure to scrub those out.

2. Selecting the right app for your connector
When you list your connector, we ask you for the app which this connector has been built for. Be sure to enter in the proper name for this app so that all Workato users can find it properly. If you're building a connector to an app which cannot be found in the dropdown, we'll need some time to verify this app before your listing is approved. Be sure to enter in the application name properly to speed up the verification process.

3. Identifying proper categories and using the right logo
Using the right logo for your connector instills trust in users who might install it. While conducting their own due diligence and research on your connector, these data points are crucial in helping potential users decide whether they want to use your connector.
